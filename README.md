### Overview

syzygy_database is the slightly modified version of Ronald de Manâ€™s syzygy database that debugs errors and focuses on calculating correct values of remoteness. 

gc_database is amy's attempt at creating a database that can calculate correct values of remoteness. using the code built by a community on the chess programming wiki (https://github.com/nguyenpham/NhatMinhEgtb/tree/master/source), amy is rebuilding and modifying the databases so that they can correctly determine remoteness and don't take the entire space of amy's laptop. as of right now, she is fixing errors in src - once this is done, the correct information will be stored in the files under databases/3, which can then be run (or hooked up) to the existing python script.
